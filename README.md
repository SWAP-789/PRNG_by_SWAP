## Custom PRNG using Linear Congruential Generator (LCG)

This project implements a custom Pseudorandom Number Generator (PRNG) using the **Linear Congruential Generator (LCG)** algorithm and compares its output with NumPy's built-in uniform distribution. The goal is to analyze the uniformity and statistical behavior of the custom generator through visualizations and basic statistics.

## Features

- Custom LCG-based PRNG implementation
- Generation of 2D pseudorandom point distributions
- Side-by-side comparison with NumPy's `np.random.uniform()`
- Scatter plots and histograms for visual analysis
- Mean and standard deviation comparison for statistical evaluation

## Visual Output

- 't1.pdf': 2D scatter plots of NumPy vs LCG distributions
- 'tt.pdf': Histograms showing distribution shapes of each PRNG's output
